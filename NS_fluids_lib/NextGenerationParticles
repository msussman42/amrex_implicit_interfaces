Each material has an associated level set function which is initialized
as a distance function locally to the interface.  each material has an
associated MAC velocity, cell velocity, density, temperature and species.
GFM used at material boundaries.

Each particle has an associated material id which is assigned when the
particle is added and modified prior to redistancing.

There are 2 kinds of particles:
a) bulk particles (min |phi_{m}|>=alpha h)

   particle_nsubdivide_bulk

b) (i) narrow band particles (min |phi_{m}| < alpha h)
   (ii) close-in narrow band particles x^init-=phi_{m} n_{m}

   particle_nsubdivide_narrow

Each particle has a position, displacement, velocity, temperature, 
and material id.


1. initialize Levelsets, make them locally distance functions.  
2. generate the AMR grid near zero level set(s).

3. add and delete particles; particles deleted if particle density exceeds
a threshold.

4. advect the level set using unsplit, non conservative semi-lagrangian 
"data bounded WENO" advection.  (advect the velocity, temperature, and
temperature using unsplit data bounded WENO too)
advect the particles.

5. for phase change, limit the normal velocity so that 
V(phi_source_old)-V(phi_source_new)=V(phi_target_new)-V(phi_target_old)

6. semi-lagranian reinitialization corrects the level set 
function so that the particle attribute is as consistent 
as possible with the interpolated levelset attribute.

1. make sure code works for single precision (VOFTOL, INTERCEPT_TOL, solver
default tolerances, etc)
2. check freezing results, restart bubble jetting.
