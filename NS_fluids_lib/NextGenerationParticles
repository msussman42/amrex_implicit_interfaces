1. use "ngrow_vector"
2. single precision
3. GPU
4. profile the advection step
5. introduce particles only on the interface.  Attribute "iten" in 
   [1..num_interfaces]. subdivide=4
6. delete particles in which |LS_{m}(xp)|>alpha dx  m=m1 or m2
   (use linear interpolation? data bounded weno?)
7. if too many particles, then delete those with the largest values for
   |LS_{m}(xp)|.
8. use MOF/CMOF reconstruction either when:
   (i) near triple point
   (ii) interface changing phase??
   (iii) prescribed solids
   (iv) too few particles in the cell
   otherwise, slope and intercept minimize |phi_recon(xp)| and the volume
   fractions and centroids are updated.
9. directionally split advection for the particles.
